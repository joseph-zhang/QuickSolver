# QuickSolver
**solver for confusion and miscellany of problems whenever it is needed**

 People usually fall in big confusion when a new environment is setting. This repo may help you solve some env-set problems, becoming a good memorandum of miscellany.
 
 ## setting
the folder for environment setting.
- set-env.sh : help you install packages on blank systems
- teredo-tunnel.sh : install and use miredo 
- utorrent-setting.sh : install and use utorrent
- .bashrc : my env-set for linux/ubuntu
- .emacs : my emacs setting
- intel-graphic.sh : intel graphics tool, optional
## solver 
the folder for solving miscellany of problems.
- ~~./caffe-maker : fixed version of caffe makefile, help you install caffe~~
- dpkg-error.sh : solve "dealing with.." error
- boot-space-problem.sh : clean /boot space  
- graphic-control.sh : switch GPU easily, optional
- ppa-problem.sh : fcitx update related, optional
- system-program-problem.sh : clear system collapse history

## exercise
the folder for OJ problems.<br>

(Note that I created a repository as algorithms storage before, but it is no use anymore.<br>
Now I think a folder for problem solving is enough, algorithm template is just a joke.)
